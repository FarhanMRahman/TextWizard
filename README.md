# TextWizard 1.1
=================================================
This is a simple text editor and word analyzer. I've implemented it using Java and Swing library.

-Two panels in the frame; one for the editor and one for the analyzer
-Used BorderLayout for the frame and GridBagLayout for the analyzar panel
-Used the Nimbus Look and Feel to draw the user interface (UI)
-Editor panel lets the user open, edit and save any text file

-Analyzer panel has some word analyzing features, such as:
  -Total word count
  -Word length percentages (e.g. Percentage of 1-letter words, 2-letter-words,...)
  -Average length of words
  -Number of occurences of a specific word in the file
-Added a menubar which has functionality of opening, saving, exiting and making a new file
-Added a checked box menu item to hide/show the analyzer panel temporarily
